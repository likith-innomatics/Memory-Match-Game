In this Memory Match Game project, I implemented several key features to enhance the user experience 
and functionality. The game includes multiple categories such as Fruits, Animals, Emojis, Planets, 
and Landmarks, allowing players to choose their preferred theme. The game is designed to be responsive, 
ensuring it works seamlessly across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones. I incorporated 
sound effects for card flips, matches, and game over scenarios to make the gameplay more engaging. 
Additionally, I added animations and transitions to provide a smooth and visually appealing experience.

The game logic involves shuffling cards and allowing players to flip them to find matching pairs. 
A timer counts down from 30 seconds, adding a layer of challenge. Players earn points for each match, 
and the game state is saved using local storage, enabling players to resume their game after a page 
refresh. This project not only demonstrates my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also showcases 
my ability to create interactive and user-friendly web applications.
